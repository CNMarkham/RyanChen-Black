Hello, my name is Ryan Chen and I have been at Code Ninjas for about a year. My 3 favourite things about being a ninja is learning how to make games, facing challenges, and having people test my game. My game is a platformer based around defeating enemies while also maneuvering across obstacles within levels. The game will have a simple combat system with a parry system that can deflect attacks when timed properly. There will also be a heart system which will be affected when the player takes damage. Finally, there will also be a dash system to give the player more mobility and movement throughout the level. The challenges I will face are very broad, ranging from not being able to figure out how coding specific mechanics, time constraints, and difficulty with designing the levels. I plan to overcome these challenges by planning out what I want to do and looking back at my old projects for support while coding.
